# PallindromeChecker

## A string is said to be a palindrome if it is the same if we start reading it from left to right or right to left.

### The PalindromeChecker class has a method palindromeChecker() which takes a String as parameter and returns whether or not that String is a palindrome.

- In the case that there are capital letters in the input string, the method changes them to lower case
- In the case that there is any white space in the input string, the method clears that space

### The PalindromeCheckerArrays class has a method palindromeCheckerArrays() which takes a String array as input and returns all the palindromes in that array
- A for loop is utilised which iterates through the passed array and uses the palindromeChecker() method to decipher whether or not each of the array items are palindromes.

### The PalindromeCheckerTests class has a number of methods which test the output of various examples
